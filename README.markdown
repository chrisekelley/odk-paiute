ODK Paiute renders json defined forms in a browser and then saves the results to couchdb.
=========================================================================================

Instructions
------------

You will need [couchdb](http://couchdb.apache.org/) to make it run:

    apt-get install couchdb

We need to create a database called "odk". You can create a new database using futon, the handy couchdb GUI by clicking here: [futon on localhost](http://localhost:5984/_utils), or by running this curl command:

    curl -X PUT http://localhost:5984/odk

To get ODK Paiute working you need to put the files in this directory into a couchdb database. You can accomplish this by using the
[couchapp tool](http://couchapp.org/page/couchapp-python).

    apt-get install couchapp

Now we can use couchapp to push the files into your database:

    couchapp push

Now you can point your browser at the [ODK Paiute](http://localhost:5984/odk/_design/render/index.html):

How does this work?
-------------------

CouchDB, [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone), json, fermented eyebrow sweat, fairy dust.


How is this organized?
----------------------

All of the backbone [models](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Model) and [views](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Model) have their own file and are in app/models and app/views respectively. app/app.js is responsible for tying it all together.

You can put json forms into the \_docs directory and they will be added to your couch when you do a couchapp push.

How do I modify form widgets?

----------------------

Look at the index2.html example. Each widget has its own handlebars.js template (see checkboxWidget). They are activated by the {{{renderWidget}}} tag in the form-element-template. 
Look at Handlebars.registerHelper("renderWidget"... in formElementRender.js, which compiles the relevant template based on the datatype in the form.
In the current example, the form is ArrestDocket.js.

Other useful info
-----------------

It's a pain to run 'couchapp push' everytime you make a change. I wrote a little [watchr](http://rubygems.org/gems/watchr) script that watches for changes to any relevant files and then automatically pushes them into your couch. To get it you need to install rubygems and watchr:

    apt-get install rubygems
    gem install watchr
